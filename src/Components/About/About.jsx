            "Hello! I'm Ashiqur Rahman Shohan, a final-year Statistics student
            at the University of Chittagong with a passion for web development
            and technology. My journey in the tech world is driven by a love for
            building things and an insatiable curiosity for learning. <br /> My skill
            set spans across HTML, CSS, Tailwind, JavaScript, DaisyUI, Python,
            C, and C++, complemented by a solid foundation in algorithms and
            data structures. I'm currently expanding my horizons by delving into
            React, having already completed a project using this cutting-edge
            framework. <br /> While web development is my current focus, my academic
            background in Statistics has kindled an interest in data science. I
            see this as a natural progression, blending my analytical skills
            with my tech expertise. <br /> What sets me apart is my self-driven
            learning approach. I've acquired most of my skills through
            self-study and targeted courses, demonstrating my ability to adapt
            and grow in this ever-evolving field. I'm excited about the
            possibilities that lie at the intersection of web development and
            data science. As I continue to learn and create, I look forward to
            contributing innovative solutions to real-world problems."
